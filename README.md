üöÄ Welcome to __AuthJS Nuxt__!  This is an edge compatible experimental Nuxt module currently in its alpha stage.
This module uses the [Auth.js](https://github.com/nextauthjs/next-auth) core implementation under the hood.
You can find the documentation [here](https://authjs-nuxt.pages.dev/) (WIP).
Contributions are welcome !

##  ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer

_üß™ This module is really unstable and is not recommended for production use. It is intended for those who want to experiment with AuthJS on the edge._


### Why not?

1. **Why not use use [Sidebase Nuxt-Auth](https://github.com/sidebase/sidebase)?**

   - Because it's not edge compatible. This module is.

2. **Why not use Auth.js directly?**
  
   - You can. However, Auth.js is currently being rewritten from Next-Auth, and wiring everything with Nuxt for the edge isn't straightforward. This gives you a good starting point and a reference implementation.

3. **Why should I use this package? I'd rather build my own auth!**

   - Auth.js gives you a good starting point to do that, and so does this package. If you want to DIY even more, give [Lucia](https://github.com/pilcrowOnPaper/lucia) a shot.

### Why ?

- It's based on [Auth.js](https://github.com/nextauthjs/next-auth)
- It works everywhere (tested on the edge)
- It's lightweight
- It's Nuxt

## üì¶ Installation

Install `@hebilicious/authjs-nuxt` and auth.js `@auth/core`  from npm :

```bash
pnpm i @hebilicious/authjs-nuxt @auth/core
```

You can use npm as well :

```bash
npm i @hebilicious/authjs-nuxt @auth/core
```

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Use

1. Create a catch-all route at `server/api/auth/[...].ts`. 

```ts
import GithubProvider from "@auth/core/providers/github"
import type { AuthConfig } from "@auth/core/types"
import { NuxtAuthHandler } from "#auth"

// The #auth virtual import comes from this module. You can use it on the client
// and server side, however not every export is universal. For example do not
// use sign-in and sign-out on the server side.

const runtimeConfig = useRuntimeConfig()

// Refer to Auth.js docs for more details
export const authOptions: AuthConfig = {
  secret: runtimeConfig.authJs.secret,
  providers: [
    GithubProvider({
      clientId: runtimeConfig.github.clientId,
      clientSecret: runtimeConfig.github.clientSecret
    })
  ]
}

export default NuxtAuthHandler(authOptions, runtimeConfig)
// If you don't want to pass the full runtime config,
//  you can pass something like this: { public: { authJs: { baseUrl: "" } } }
```

2. Configure your Nuxt settings as shown below (GitHub example) :

 ```ts
import { resolve } from "node:path"

export default defineConfig({
   modules: ["@hebilicious/authjs-nuxt"],
   // Add these aliases if you are running into import errors
   alias: {
     //  "cookie": resolve(__dirname, "node_modules/cookie"),
     //  "jose": resolve(__dirname, "node_modules/jose/dist/browser/index.js"),
     //  "@panva/hkdf": resolve(__dirname, "node_modules/@panva/hkdf/dist/web/index.js")
   },
   runtimeConfig: {
     authJs: {
       secret: process.env.NUXT_NEXTAUTH_SECRET // You can generate one with `openssl rand -base64 32`
     },
     github: {
       clientId: process.env.NUXT_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID,
       clientSecret: process.env.NUXT_GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET
     },
     public: {
       authJs: {
         baseUrl: process.env.NUXT_NEXTAUTH_URL, // The base URL is used for the Origin Check in prod only
         verifyClientOnEveryRequest: true // whether to hit the /auth/session endpoint on every client request
       }
     }
   }
})
  ```
  
Note that you can use whatever environment variables you want here, this is just an example.

__Remember__: this is an alpha, use with caution! üèá
